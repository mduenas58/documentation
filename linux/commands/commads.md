### Input, Output, and Pipes

The six commands —`wc, head, cut, grep, sort, and uniq`— have numerous options and modes of operation. For now will focus on pipes.

Command #1: `wc`
The `wc` command prints the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.

Command #2: `head`
The `head` command prints the first lines of a file.

Command #3: `cut`
The `cut` command prints one or more columns from a file.

Command #4: `grep`
`grep` is an extremely powerful command, but for now I’ll hide most of its capabilities and say it prints lines that match a given string.

Command #5: `sort`
The `sort` command reorders the lines of a file into ascending order (the default):

Command #6: `uniq`
The uniq command detects repeated, adjacent lines in a file. By default, it removes the repeats.
